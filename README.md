[Opening] "As a staffing agency, managing identity verification for new hires can be time-consuming. Today, I'll show you how Vortel streamlines this process by automatically extracting and validating candidate information from their documents."

[Demo] "Let me show you how simple it is:

    Start by uploading identity documents - Vortel accepts passports, driver's licenses, and other ID documents in various formats.
    Behind the scenes, the engine, powered by OCR, document parsing, and Large Language Models extracts the information.
    The system clearly indicates validated fields, items needing review, and any missing information.

[Key Benefits] "Instead of manually typing information from various documents, Vortel:

    Automatically fits the extracted data into your schema
    Reduces human error in data entry
    Leverages AI to understand and process documents like a human would
    Maintains data accuracy with built-in validation

[Flexibility] "While we're demonstrating identity verification today, Vortel's powerful combination of OCR and AI makes it adaptable to any structured document type. Tomorrow, you could be:

    Processing purchase orders
    Extracting invoice data
    Handling shipping documents Simply define your data schema, and Vortel's intelligent engine adapts to extract exactly what you need, in the format you want."
